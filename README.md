Dirty scripts for doing stuff with The Silent Library on ipfs.  In their current form these are just hacked together and have very little (if any) error checking.  They work, though.

Uploading to ipfs:
- hash-list - a csv dump of what was uploaded. created by add-tsl.sh (actually seperated by ':')
- add-tsl.sh - simple shell script to go through the TSL directories and upload the files to ipfs. This dumps a file (hash-list) that has necessary details of what files are uploaded.

Generating HTML page:
- populate-db.py: script to populate a db.
- database.ini.sample: sample db config file. rename to database.ini
- generate-html.py: script to connect to the db and generate an html

HTML pages
- list.html: generated by generate-html.py
- treeview.css: needed css file
